## Theory

### a) Primary purpose of Pydantic
Pydantic provides automatic data validation and type enforcement using Python type hints.
It ensures data correctness and prevents invalid data from entering the application.

### b) Difference between model_validate() and model_validate_json()
model_validate() validates Python objects such as dictionaries.
model_validate_json() validates JSON strings directly.

### c) How to define constrained fields
Use Field with constraints.

Example:
age: int = Field(ge=0, le=130)

### d) How Pydantic improves API robustness
It validates external data, catches errors early, provides clear error messages,
and ensures the application always works with correct data types.

### e) What is a computed field?
A computed field is a derived field calculated from other fields in the model.
It is not provided by the user but generated automatically.
